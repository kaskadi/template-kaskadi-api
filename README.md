# Testing

`mocha`, `chai`, `nyc`, `serverless-offline` & `standard` are available as dev dependencies.

A `build` workflow (see [here](./.github/workflows/build.yml)) is running on `pull request` and will execute your test suite before allowing you to merge your PR. It also has a `coverage` job already prepared that you can comment out as soon as your testing is in place and your `REPORTER_ID` is in the repository secrets. This is the ID on _Code Climate_ used for uploading code coverage reports.

Along `build`, a `syntax-check` workflow will also run to check your `serverless.yml` file syntax.

****

# Deploying

Deploying to AWS is done automatically via a `deploy` workflow (see [here](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml)). This workflow will run on `push` to `master`. Before publishing, it checks for syntax error in your `serverless.yml` file.

**Warning: you may need to manually deploy the first time via `Serverless` CLI locally.**

# Tools

## Add new endpoints

In order to add new endpoints:
1. Go to the root of your API repository
2. Run `npm run add-lambda <lambda_name> <http_method> <path/to/your/lambda>`
3. Your endpoint is now located under `lambdas/<lambda_name>` and you can start developing!

## Upgrade API version

To update your API version, run `npm run upgrade-version <version_option>`. This takes the same argument as `npm version` (see [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version)). It will update for you the main `package.json` as well as `serverless.json` but also all `package.json` for all endpoints.

# Using custom domain for your API

_For all custom domains you will need a certificate for this domain. Please make sure that you have the proper certificate generated, else create one associated with your domain. All this can be done [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/)_

**Case 1: creating a new custom domain for API**

If the custom domain you wish to use hasn't been created yet (list of custom domains [here](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=eu-central-1#/custom-domain-names)).

1. Go [here](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=eu-central-1#/custom-domain-names) and click on _Create Custom Domain Name_
2. Configure your domain as you wish to
3. Once the domain is created and initialized, go to [Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?region=eu-central-1)
4. Go into the _Hosted Zone_ for the domain you wish to use and create a new _A Record_.
5. For this record, you should toggle the _Alias_ option, give for _name_ the custom domain name you wish to use and select for _Alias target_ the API you want to map to this domain. You may need to copy paste the base URL to that API to make this work

**Case 2: using an existing custom domain**

1. Go [here](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=eu-central-1#/custom-domain-names)
2. Click on _Edit_ for the custom domain you wish to use
3. Add a base path you wish to map your API to for this domain and then select the API & its stage in the dropdown menus

**Attention:** you can only use an existing custom domain if this domain doesn't have already an empty path as base path.
